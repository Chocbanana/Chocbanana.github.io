I am very happy about the state of web development today: oriented towards simplicity and portability and extensibility, modular code, near-standardized methodology, but most of all I love how much incredibly useful code the community has put out!! I barely scratched the surface but even then most of this website is composed of work by others.

<b> This site:</b>
- ...was produced by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. I went with this instead of something like wordpress because it keeps thigns simple, light, but also in the original webcoding form so there is no murky layer in between me as a developer/user and the source for my site. So basically it gives me full control with minimal extraneous learning.
- ...is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Free hosting (I'm not sure for how many GBs but I don't need much), and is integrated with Jekyll so as soon as you push changes Github processes your folder and spits out a site!
- ...is distributed and uses the DNS from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). This sped up the redirect from the github page to my custom domain A LOT, and the service also provides some strong basic security as well as analytics. For free! Man I love the modern age
- ...uses the theme [Feeling Responsive](http://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) made by phlow. The theme uses [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), which is a codebase for styling and formatting the elements on a page.
- ...uses a bunch of other random services/widgets, like [Wufoo](http://www.wufoo.com/) for the contact form, [Disqus](https://disqus.com/home/) for comments, [FlickrIt](https://flickrit.com/) for producing Flickr galler slideshow widgets (IF I COULD ACTUALLY GET IT TO WORK), and others I probably forgot to list.


<b>I hope to eventually use:</b>
- a [style guide](https://github.com/jeromecoupe/jekyllstyleguide) to organize the changeable visual elements
- [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), a very nice and flexible set of icons (that can also move!)
- the [iPython/Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to demonstrate and examine code that I use, like neural network libraries


Happy browsing!! <3
