I have such lofty plans, optimistic timelines, and obsessive ideas... but I always forget about the finite resource that is time.

## Future Plans
- Implement a neural network visualization using [sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/)
- Get NN training/evolution set up with [Lasagne](http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [Fractal](http://www.delimited.io/blog/2014/2/20/fractal-ferns-in-d3) [visualization](https://github.com/vicapow/d3-fractal-art) using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/)


## TODO for website
* FIX FLICKR GALLERY EMBEDDING
* Document what Js is included because right now it's just one weird copypasta file
* Implement style guide, so that themes can be shifted
* Integrate social media sharing for posts, and for contacting me
* Use font awesome instead of current icons
* Add borders to posts (excluding everything below meta information)
* Clean up directory
* Implement RSS/Atom feed
* Make new logo, doesn't even have to be good just less janky and more original
* Fix archive displays
* Randomize/auto-assign header images


## Done
- Set up Flickr galleries
- Lauch site
- Spend a lot of time reading up on random things but also RNNs, web dev, network visualization, jekyll, and theano
