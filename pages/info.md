I am a neuroscientist/artist/programmer, just trying my best to survive. My evenutal, distant hazy dream is to birth a truly intelligent artifical brain, but we are a long way from that.... In the meantime though I guess I'll settle for reading and devouring all the knowledge I can.


### Inspirations

[Kenenth O. Stanely](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/)'s papers solidified my ideas about patterns, evolution, and artistic output in neural networks.
[Vi Hart](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart) and her fractal math class doodling...
[Yuumei](http://yuumei.deviantart.com/), from her intense focus on eyes, light, and beauty above all else.
Albert Camus... absurdism and The Stranger gave me the words to describe the all-encompassing frustration with existence, that I suspect we all feel to an extent.


### Contact me
On my [contact page](/contact/), duh :D

But since I haven't got my social media lnks together, my portfolio gallery is hosted [on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/135898386@N03/albums") and code is all [on Github](https://github.com/Chocbanana) (although I honestly don't have that much up at this time)
